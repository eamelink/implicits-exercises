/**
 * This application uses a logger to log what it's doing.
 * Currently, it's annoying that we have to pass around the 'logSettings' manually.
 * 
 * Exercises:
 * 1) Pass the log settings around implicitly.
 * 2) How would you provide a 'default' `LogSettings` instance, for if we want to log
 *    without defining a custom `LogSettings`?
 * 3) Suppose that you generally want to log without the datetime, but you do want it for the 
 *    last log statement, where you log 'Bye'. How do you do that?
